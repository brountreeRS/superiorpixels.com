Quite simply, the biggest, broadest, best finance site on the web. Number 1 in terms of page views, audience size, time spent, uniques and just about any other metric that matters. I was honored to work with a fantastic team of engineers, user experience folks, quality engineers and product managers on this juggernaut of a web site. As one of the Software Architects, it was my job to make sure that the site scaled, screamed, streamed data in real time, from every exchange on the planet.
