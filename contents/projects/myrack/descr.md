The MyRackspace control panel (MyRack) is the primary entry point for Rackspace's massive base of dedicated hosting customers. In MyRack, customers can manage their configurations, set up access rules, spin up new devices, create tickets, pay their bill, connect to the Rackspace Open Cloud and many other features. All wrapped up in a tidy user interface.
